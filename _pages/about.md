I’m Abdollah, a graduate student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at [UC Berkeley](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/). I received my Bachelor of Science and my Masters in Statistics and Probability Theory from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). I am specializing in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine/Deep Learning. I previously worked on a data science project where I use many different qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to study and analyze public health data, while trying to reach two goals: 1) to predict if a person is addicted to pain-killers or not, and 2) understand pain and find ways to treat it optimally.

My interest in finance led me to spend 5 months working for [BNP Paribas][1] as a Quantitative Researcher in New York City, where I developed innovative ways of creating Credit Scorecards on several portfolios using Machine and Deep Learning. I was the President of [X-Ray][2], [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en)'s Radio, and the  Director of External Relations at my school's student association [JTX](http://binet-jtx.com/jtx). I also was Head of the Communication department at [X-Entreprises](http://www.xentreprises.com/en/), and I am also a boxer.

I will be uploading my school projects as well as many side projects on my [Github repositories](https://github.com/AbdollahRida). My resume is available [here](https://abdollahrida.github.io/cv/), and is also on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdollah-rida/?locale=en_US).
