Hi! I’m Abdollah, an Undergraduate student at [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). I am taking courses in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics/Statistics, but I have just enough passion finance and data science to make trouble. I am actually working on a data science project where I use many different qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to study and analyze publice health data, while trying to uphold two goals: 1) to predict if a person A is addicted to pain-killers or not, and 2) reach a breakthrough in the understanding and treatment of pain in France.

I will receive my BS from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), and will get my Masters degree from there. I’m also the current ead of the Communication department at [X-Entreprises](http://www.xentreprises.com/en/), and the  Director of External Relations at my school's student association [JTX](http://binet-jtx.com/jtx).
