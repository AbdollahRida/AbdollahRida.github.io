Hi! I’m Abdollah, an Undergraduate student at [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en). I will receive my BS from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) at the end of this year, and will start my Masters degree next year. I am actually working on a data science project where I use many different qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to study and analyze publice health data, while trying to reach two goals: 1) to predict if a person is addicted to pain-killers or not, and 2) understand pain and find ways to treat it optimally.

I am taking courses in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics/Statistics, but I have just enough passion for finance and data science to make trouble. I’m the current Head of the Communication department at [X-Entreprises](http://www.xentreprises.com/en/), and the  Director of External Relations at my school's student association [JTX](http://binet-jtx.com/jtx). I am also an active member of my school's boxing club.

I will be uploading my course projects as well as many side projects on my [Github repositories](https://github.com/AbdollahRida).   My resume is available [here](https://abdollahrida.github.io/cv/), and is also on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdollah-rida/).
